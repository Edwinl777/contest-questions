# Programming Challenges Solution Repository
Includes solutions for uWaterloo's CCC, Hackerrank, GeeksForGeeks, LeetCode, Google Kickstart, and some useful graph algorithms in python 3.

NOTE: I made this so that others may learn from the techniques I have used to solve problems that may or may not be mainstream. An example of this is [2012 S4 / J5](../master/CCC/2012/S4 A Coin Game.py). The solution found online for Python3 is made by 4 - 5 people, uses a technique as if they were programming in c++, and barely based the test cases (in terms of time). The solution I made at the time wasn't efficient because I had never used the data structure called a set. As soon as I changed the data structure from a list to a set, my solution became more efficient than the other solution! Another note. I've also noticed that there is a lack of organization / design / aesthetic when it comes to programmers sharing their solutions, and this is how I think it should be done.
